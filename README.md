}
```

## Logging

All requests and processing steps are logged with structured data. Example log entries:

```

2024-01-15T10:30:00.124Z	INFO	Starting to fetch and parse article	{"url": "https://example.com/article"}

```

## Development

To run the enhanced version:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o bin/api cmd/api/main.go
   ```

2. Run with development settings:
   ```bash
   PORT=8080 ENV=development ./bin/api
   ```

3. Test with the included script:
   ```bash
   ./test_api.sh
   ```

The application will create a `tmp/` directory for debugging files and log all processing steps with detailed information.
